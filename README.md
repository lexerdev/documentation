The home of our various API, Gem and other public documentation.
That's right, **PUBLIC**.

Whatever is here is publicly available at http://developer.lexer.io.

## How to run

    # run a server on http://localhost:7890
    bundle exec middleman server --port=7890

## How to build

    # build the documentation for deployment
    bundle exec rake build

Builds are written to source and that folder is to be deployed.
No special tech required, it's a static site.
