# Introduction

Welcome to the Lexer API documentation.

We currently offer the following APIs to our clients:

- **Command API**: read the data powering your live screens.

- **Chatbot API**: integrate a chatbot into your team.

- **Activity API**: read service team performance metrics (Coming Soon)

- **Identity API**: Allowing clients to Contribute and Consume Identity data from the Lexer platform.

All of our APIs communicate via HTTPS and JSON data.

Lexer operates a fair use policy on all of its APIs.
