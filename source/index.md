# Introduction

Welcome to the Lexer API documentation.

We currently offer the following APIs to our clients:

- **Command API**: Allowing you to read the data powering charts.

- **Chatbot API**: Integrating your chatbot to claim ownership of conversations it is handling.

- **Activity API**: Allowing you to read team performance metrics collected about your team in Engage.

- **Identity API**: Allowing clients to Contribute and Consume Identity data from the Lexer platform.

All of our APIs communicate via HTTPS and JSON data.

Our _Activity_ API is currently under development.


## Fair Use

Lexer operates a fair use policy on all of its APIs.
